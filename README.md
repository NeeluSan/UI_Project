UI Project:
-----------

I have worked on this project to showcase my HTML, CSS, JavaScript & JQuery skills.
In this project, I have created a UI for a non-existent medical facility. Some of the highlights are:

* SomeHealthCare.html - This is the home page for the website. It displays the login page. 
                        Javascript code has been used to verify that the user has entered a username, and then check if the password is
                        atleast 8 characters long. It disables login if the user fails to enter a valid-length password on 3 attempts.

* locations.html - This page displays addresses, contact info, and embedded maps from Bing Maps.
                   JQuery has been used to display/hide the maps on demand.

* Articles tab - JQuery has been used to slideToggle the sub-menu on clicking this tab.

* physicians.html - This page displays pictures of 'doctors' and some information about them.

This project has used HTML files for demonstrative purposes only. In real world, ASP.NET Web Pages could be used, taking advantage of 
the Layout directive for achieving a consistent look throughout the website.
